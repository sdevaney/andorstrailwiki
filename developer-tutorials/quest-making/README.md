# Quest Creation

This area will help you learn to develop quests for Andor's Trail. Be sure you have read the [World](../../contributor-section/world/) & [Lore](../../player-faq/game-and-world-lore/lore.md) sections to help tie your idea into relevant storylines.

Please check the list of available [NPCs](../../contributor-section/npcs-and-their-creation.md) before crossing your quest idea with another.

## Overview

The mini-howto on making a quest for Andor’s Trail is something like this:

### **Define the structure**

1. Think up a general idea for what the quest should be about.
2. Create a rough flowchart for the different choices and actions that the player may take.
3. Write the quest log.

### Create any new content.

1. Create NPCs using the content editor.
2. Place NPCs on maps.
3. Create quest items and drop-lists using the content editor.

### Dialogue

Write the dialogue for all involved NPCs.

### Publish

The above steps will be described in detail on their respective pages.

The hardest part is, by far, writing the dialogue. Writing the dialogue is also the most interesting part, since it allows you to customize the tone of the quest and the characteristics of each involved NPC. It’s the storytelling part of the quest.
