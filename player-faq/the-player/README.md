# The Player

### Character Motivations

Try and leave room for the player to give their own motivations to the PC. Quests should have multiple options for the player to express their play style.

## Character Development

Character development is based on experience given by killing monsters or by doing quests. Experience leads to leveling up, which increases stats and gives skill points.
