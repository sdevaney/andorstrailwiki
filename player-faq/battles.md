### Combat Turn Order

1. Calculate each combatant's Action Points (AP)
2. The highest AP acts first.
3. After the action, AP decreases by the action cost.
4. When all combatants reach 0 AP, reset and repeat.
5. Combat ends when all enemies are defeated or the player dies.

When engaging in combat with a tough monster, sometimes the best action is to flee and return later when you have built up your character and equipment more.

## Fleeing

### How to flee

1. Engage in combat by attacking a monster, or wait until it's your time to start your attack turn.
2. Select a square to move to that doesn't have any monsters on it.
3. **Long-press that square.**
4. Notice how the square lights up yellow, thus indicating that you have selected it.
5. Also, notice that the “Attack” button has changed to a “Move” button.
6. Tap the screen (or tap the Move button) to move to that square.
7. Hopefully, you should now be in a square that doesn't have any monsters adjacent to it.
8. Tap the screen (or tap “End combat”) to end combat.
9. Combat ends. You have fled the fight.
10. Make sure to kill that bastard later :)

## Selecting a Target

Long-pressing an adjacent square also allows you to select a different monster to attack.
