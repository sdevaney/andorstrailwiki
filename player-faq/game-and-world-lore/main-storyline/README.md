# Main Storyline

### Core Premise

Andor's Trail follows a young protagonist searching for their missing brother, Andor, throughout the world of **Dhayavar**. The game begins in the small farming village of Crossglen, where the player character wakes up in their father, Mikhail's, house to discover that their adventurous brother has disappeared without a trace.

### The Journey

While the surface quest is to find the missing brother, the deeper narrative reveals that **the journey itself transforms the protagonist from a simple farmer into a seasoned adventurer**. As one community member observed:&#x20;

> _"I personally believe the main point of the journey of Andor's Trail isn't to necessarily bring your brother home, but by chasing him you come into your own as an adventurer and become strong and wise, learning many things and meeting many people along the way"_. - DawnPhoenix

#### The Mysteries of Andor's Trail

The storyline takes darker turns as evidence suggests that **Andor may be orchestrating events from behind the scenes**. Community theories indicate that:â€‹

* Andor has been influencing major conflicts, including the **Prim vs. Blackwater Mountain dispute.**
* He may be connected to the appearance of dangerous creatures like **Gornauds** and **Auleath.**
* Some suspect he has a role in **awakening Hiraziin** and other catastrophic events.
* He might even be manipulating the **Kazaul rituals** and shadow cult activities.

### **Political and Religious Conflicts**

The world is torn between two major power structures:

**Feygard Empire** vs. **Nor City Shadow Cult**

* **Feygard**: Led by Lord Geomyr, represents authoritarian order and law.
* **Nor City**: Follows Shadow worship, emphasizes personal freedom, and places less emphasis on consequences.
* The conflict stems from competing ideologies about governance and religious/societal freedom.

### **The Overarching Threat**

The ultimate storyline builds toward confronting ancient evils, including:

* **Hiraziin**: A powerful ancient entity that players must eventually face.
* **Kazaul Rituals**: Dark ceremonies that threaten to unleash catastrophic forces.
* **The Shadow**: A complex spiritual force that may be connected to dark worship.
* **Lord Geomyr**: The authoritarian ruler ready to crush any opposition.
