# Villages

## Feygard

Ruled by Lord Geomyr.

The people of Feygard believe in a strong leader who tells them what to do. They prosper thanks to their leader's firm hand. In some cases, their leader makes hard choices that cause significant grief for a small number of people while providing a substantial benefit to the majority.

They believe in following the law to the letter. They prefer things that are organized rather than haphazard. They are happy about getting strong protection from the guards of Feygard.

Some people employed by Feygard (guards, lawmen) may be corrupt, since they want to take part of the wealth of Feygard for themselves.

The leaders of Feygard generally give the best support to the people who live in or near Feygard itself, but neglect the people living in villages farther away from the city. Some settlements far away support Feygard by paying taxes (gold, food, livestock, equipment), but they do not get as much in return as they pay.

If there is a disagreement between two people from Feygard, they both want the guards to sort it out. This can, of course, mean that a wealthy family might have support from the guards in other ways.

## Nor City

No clear ruler or leader. Most major decisions come from the priests of the Shadow.

Most people in Nor City believe in the Shadow. Their faith gives them peace of mind and a sense of being able to accomplish anything.

The priests of Nor City have been secretly experimenting with necromancy. The people who have found out about this agree with it, except for the smell. It might provide them with a way to meet old relatives or extend their lives.

People believe in having their own freedom to do whatever they want, without someone dictating what they can and cannot do. Most people do what they consider their correct course of action, even if it goes against whatever “rules” there may be.

This does not imply that they are immoral towards each other, since most people hold moral choices in high regard.

Old customs and their heritage are essential to the people of Nor City. Some actions are based on what people have done for generations. Feygard has prohibited some of these things, but the people of Nor City do not care that they are banned. (bonemeal, rituals, things that would be considered “immoral” ).

The people trust each other.

If two people from Nor City disagree, they resolve it themselves. Either with support from their families, or by themselves, right there and then.

## Blackwater Mountain/Prim

This represents two competing settlements in the mountain region, where players must choose allegiances. The choice between these settlements is one of the game's major moral decisions with lasting consequences.

## Crossglen

Crossglen is the humble beginning of your adventure—a small agricultural village where the protagonist and their family live. This peaceful farming community serves as the tutorial area where players learn basic game mechanics.\
Key NPCs include Mikhail (father), Mara (at the town hall), Leta (missing husband quest), and various farmers. The village faces typical rural problems, such as rat infestations and missing persons.

## Fallhaven

Fallhaven is the first significant settlement players encounter - a bustling town that serves as the commercial hub for the starting region. The city has a more complex social structure with both legitimate businesses and criminal elements. Notable locations include the derelict houses, stables, and multiple taverns where adventurers gather.

## Loneford

Loneford is notable for suffering from a mysterious illness that affects many residents. The "Flows Through the Veins" quest concerns the mysterious illness plaguing the town's inhabitants.

## Remgard

Remgard is distinguished by its strategic location behind a guarded bridge and its orderly administration. The town represents a more organized settlement with formal governance and structured entry procedures.

## Vilegard

Vilegard is characterized by its inhabitants' deep suspicion of outsiders. The "Trusting an Outsider" quest specifically focuses on gaining acceptance in this community, and visitors must prove themselves at the chapel before being welcomed.

## Brimhaven

Located deep in the hills and difficult to reach, the town faces various threats, including basilisks and potential sabotage of its infrastructure.

## Brightport

## Stoutford

Known for its ancient castle and undead problems. The town's defining feature is dealing with its haunted historical legacy.
