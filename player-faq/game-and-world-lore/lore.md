# Lore

### **The World of Dhayavar**

The name **Dhayavar** comes from ancient Avestan words meaning "the land of choices", reflecting the game's emphasis on moral decisions and competing factions.

### **Historical Context**

* **Golden Age**: Once united under the righteous King Luthor, with strong royal guards protecting trade routes.
* **Collapse**: Civil war between city-lords led to the kingdom's fragmentation.
* **Current Era**: Multiple factions compete to fill the power vacuum as ancient threats resurface.

### **Religious Landscape**

* **The Shadow**: Modern spiritual movement emphasizing personal freedom, possibly derived from ancient Kazaul worship.
* **Kazaul/Elythara**: Ancient deities that some still worship in secret cults.
* **No True Gods**: The world operates on the principle that there are no active deities, only spiritual forces and concepts.

#### The Shadow

The Shadow is not a god or a being, but rather a concept, like the shadows cast by light. Some people in the world of Andorâ€™s Trail view the Shadow as their savior from bad things that happen.

It should be left unclear whether there actually is any divine presence that helps people who believe in the Shadow, or whether their luck comes from their own choices.

The priests of the Shadow are fascinated by necromancy, undead, and bringing life to things that have been dead or lost. (Meeting dead relatives? / eternal life? / building armies against Feygard?)

#### Kazaul & Elythara

Kazaul and Elythara were deities once believed in by people. Nowadays, people put their trust in the rulers of Feygard or in the Shadow. The concept of the Shadow originated among former worshippers of Kazaul, but the people who follow the Shadow disapprove of Kazaul.

Some people still worship the old gods, and their altars can be found throughout the land. There have been rumors of cults following the old gods.

#### Feygard vs Nor City

The leaders of Feygard have a strong dislike for the mindset of the people of Nor City, in that they do not follow the law in the same way that people from Feygard do. The leaders of Feygard have come up with a (secret) plan to overthrow the priests of Nor City and gain the people's trust. This plan involves harsher prohibitions, imprisonment, and the use of brute force.

The people of Nor City strongly dislike the leadership of Feygard because they are not allowed to do what they want. Some people in Nor City have come up with a (secret) plan to overturn the leaders of Feygard. This plan involves sabotage, sacrifice, and necromantic invasion.

### **Major Threats**

* **Gornauds**: Monstrous creatures from the western lands.
* **Undead Liches**: Ancient evil awakening in forgotten caves.
* **Dark Cultists**: Secret practitioners of dangerous ancient magic.
* **Political Instability**: Ongoing conflicts between Feygard authoritarianism and Shadow traditionalism.
