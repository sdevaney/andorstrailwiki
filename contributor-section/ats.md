# ATS

Script files are located in the res/raw/ folder of the project, as plain-text .ats files. The file extension used doesn't matter, but it helps for identification. ATS stands for Andor's Trail Script. There is a detailed breakdown on [the forums](https://andorstrail.com/viewtopic.php?t=4342).
