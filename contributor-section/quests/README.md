# Quests

Quests should offer as much choice as possible to the player. Prefer quests that can be solved in more than one way. Examples of solutions to quests:

* The player gains gold at the expense of the well-being of NPCs.
* The player gains stats, but some NPC dies.
* The player helps a NPC by sacrificing a piece of equipment.
* The player gains trust from some NPC, but has to travel to a lot of places and do a lot to gain trust.
* The player chooses to side with the main monster boss, and gains equipment but also distrust from other NPCs.
* The player chooses a conversation option stating that they have no intention of performing the quest.
