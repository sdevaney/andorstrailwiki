## How can I help?

The following things are currently needed:

* Creating more maps. See the [map making guidelines](../developer-tutorials/mapmaking-guidelines/).
* Code development. See [developer guidelines](../developer-tutorials/contributing-code/).
* Coding updates and new features on the [content editor](atcs.md).
* Documentation. How the game works, updates to these [docs](https://andorstrail.gitbook.io/docs/), [Player FAQ's](../player-faq.md), [Developer FAQ's](development-faq.md), tips and tricks, etc.
* Ideas for new features. See the [forums](https://andorstrail.com) or [issue](https://github.com/Zukero/andors-trail/issues) tracker.
