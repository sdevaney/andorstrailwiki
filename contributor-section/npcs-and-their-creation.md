# NPCs and their creation

## Character Personalities

All characters base their actions on reasoning or a strong belief that what they are doing is the right thing to do.

Characters are not “good” or “evil”. They do what they see as their best course of action based on their past experiences. Some NPCs may be generous towards the player because they think that being generous might provide them with some benefit in the future. Some NPCs may be bitter because of past events involving other people or the player.

## Dialogue

Prefer to have many different dialogue options for the player to choose from, with varying player personalities, even if some options lead to the same result. It gives the player a way to express their personality more and adds depth to the player's experience.
