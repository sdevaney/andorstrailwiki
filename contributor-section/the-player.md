# The Player

### Character Motivations

Try to leave room for the player to give their own motivations to the PC. Quests should offer multiple options for players to express their play style.

## Character Development

Character development is based on experience gained from killing monsters or from doing quests. Experience levels up, increasing stats and granting skill points.
