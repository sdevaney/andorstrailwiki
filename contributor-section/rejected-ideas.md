# Rejected Ideas

## Music

Large downloads, low priority (but if we find the proper content/composer/license, it could be an option)

## Classes

The player should develop their character based on their actions throughout the game, not on a predefined advancement path.

## Multiplayer

The app would need internet access permission, and we would need a central server (which introduces real-world costs and requires maintenance, in addition to the actual coding). Would have to solve the issue with people who want to cheat.

## Online Play

No features that need internet access.

## Teleporting

No fast travel. Boats maybe???

## Auto-leveling Monsters

Similar to Oblivion, their difficulty should be predetermined based on the area that they spawn in.
