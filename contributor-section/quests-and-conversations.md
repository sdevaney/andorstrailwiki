The words “good” and “evil” should be discouraged as much as possible, unless in extreme cases where it is made very clear that they refer to a subjective feeling.

Do not use the word “God”, as in “oh my God”. There are no Gods in the world of Andor’s Trail. See section on “The Shadow” below.

Challenge things that are considered “wrong” from IRL into being somewhat accepted in the world of Andor’s Trail. Give the player dialogue options to challenge perceptions of what is morally acceptable and what is not.

For example, a group of NPCs may persuade the player to do things that would be morally unacceptable IRL, or give the player the option to refuse and challenge those NPCs. Later on, the game should ask the player for the reasoning behind those choices, so the player has to think about why they were the correct ones.

Also, things that are considered morally correct IRL should be questioned in the game. Prefer quests where the player must justify their actions towards other NPCs.

## Example

Quest logs should be written in the first tense.

```
Correct: “I met an old man that [something]”
```

VS

```
Incorrect: “The player met an old man that [something]”
```

The quests and storyline should aim to be as nonlinear as possible, meaning the player can travel to parts of the world and complete them before tackling other quests in the starting villages. Some parts of the main storyline will be linear, but most parts should aim to be as nonlinear as possible.
