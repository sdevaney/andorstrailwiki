# Quest Creation

Quests should offer the player as many choices as possible. Prefer quests that can be solved in more than one way. Examples of solutions to quests:

* The player gains gold at the expense of the well-being of NPCs.
* The player gains stats, but some NPC dies.
* The player helps an NPC by sacrificing a piece of equipment.
* The player gains trust from some NPCs, but has to travel to many places and put in a lot of effort to earn it.
* The player chooses to side with the main monster boss and gains equipment, but also distrust from other NPCs.
* The player chooses a conversation option stating that they have no intention of performing the quest.

### **Level Recommendations**

* **Early Game** (Levels 1-15): Crossglen and Fallhaven area quests.
* **Mid Game** (Levels 16-35): Vilegard, Remgard, and mountain conflicts.
* **Late Game** (Levels 36-50+): Lodar questlines.
* **Endgame** (Level 50+): Hira'zinn confrontation and endgame content.
