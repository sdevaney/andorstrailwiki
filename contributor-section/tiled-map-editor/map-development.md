# Map Development

### Map Creation Process

1. **Planning**:
   * Sketch the map layout and connections
   * Identify key locations and NPCs
   * Plan quest integration points
2. **Tiled Setup**:
   * Open existing maps for reference
   * Use proper tileset configurations
   * Maintain consistent tile size (32x32 pixels)
3. **Layer Management**:
   * Start with Ground layer for terrain
   * Add Objects layer for details
   * Use Above layer for overhanging elements
   * Mark non-walkable areas in Walkable layer
4. **Object Placement**:
   * Add spawn areas for monsters/NPCs
   * Configure map change areas for transitions
   * Place signs and interactive elements
   * Set up key areas for quest triggers

### Map Guidelines

### Visual Standards

* Maintain consistent art style with existing maps
* Use appropriate tile combinations for natural-looking terrain
* Ensure proper contrast between walkable and non-walkable areas
* Add visual depth with shadows and layering

### Technical Requirements

* Keep map sizes reasonable for performance
* Minimize object count where possible
* Use efficient tileset references
* Test map transitions thoroughly

### Integration with World Map

* Position maps logically within the world
* Maintain consistent scale and style
* Connect properly to adjacent maps
* Update world map coordinates

### Advanced Map Features

### Conditional Map Objects

Use actor conditions and quest states to show/hide map elements:

* Doors that open after quest completion
* NPCs that appear based on story progress
* Environmental changes reflecting plot events

### Dynamic Content

* Spawn areas that activate/deactivate with scripts
* Map changes that unlock with quest progress
* Interactive elements with complex scripting
