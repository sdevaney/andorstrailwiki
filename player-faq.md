### What parts of the game is not completed? <a id="what_parts_of_the_game_is_not_completed"></a>

There are several parts of the game unfinished because it is still a work in progress. The quests which cannot be completed are listed here. Many thanks to ScorpionZ for putting together that list.

### Where can i find item/person/place ... ? <a id="where_can_i_find_itempersonplace"></a>

If you have trouble finding something be sure to explore completely as some spots are hidden. If you still cannot find where something is, read the forums as more than likely someone else has already asked where whatever you are looking for is.

### When is the next release? <a id="when_is_the_next_release"></a>

I know everyone is anxious for an update and I can completely understand that. We do not put a time limit on our development cycles, we pick specific things we wish to get done and then do them, once that list is done the release is done.

There are only a few of us that work on these releases as well so my suggestion is if you would like to see faster releases then please give us a hand by helping with the content creation.

That does not mean you have to write code to help, we can use help with making maps, writing dialog, creating quests, unique items and monsters, etc. All of which are a big part of each and every release. Even if you feel you can't help in any of those ways I listed you can also help us by being active here on the forums and spreading the word of this great game and community to others, that in itself is a big help.

### How about a list of some unique items? <a id="how_about_a_list_of_some_unique_items"></a>
